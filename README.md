## How It Works

### Normal Mode (Default)
- Short button press (<500ms): Enters a dot `.`
- Long button press (â‰¥500ms): Enters a dash `-`
- No input for 2 seconds: Automatically decodes the Morse sequence
- OLED display: Shows the decoded text
- Buzzer: Plays a short beep for dots and a long beep for dashes

### Game Mode
- Activated by pressing the Game Mode button
- A random target word appears on the OLED screen
- Input Morse code for each letter of the target word
- LED feedback:
  - Correct: LED blinks and a success message is displayed
  - Incorrect: Error message is displayed
- Toggle back to Normal Mode with the Game Mode button

## Future Improvements
- Implement letter deletion on input errors
- Add another LED for error notification
- Expand game mode with difficulty levels and time challenges
